Up until I got to my first portfolio project - Ruby CLI gem -.I was quite confident about my programming abilities. By then I'd been actively learning coding stuff for a little more than half a year: with dozens of solved labs on Learn.Co and hundreds of hours spent on tutorials and googling things around. I know it sounds naive, but I really thought I got it, and my journey to mastering code will be a piece of cake. But once I browesed through that initial README with all the requirements for my next project... I simply didn't know where to start!

What was even more intimidating is that I had to create the whole structure on my own: from the idea for the app all the way to design and implementation. Learn.Co is a cool platform to study and write code, but you never deal with this kind of stuff: it's all lined up and built for you, and your only job is to write the code which satisfies tests that are also provided. I still think it's the best way to go for a complete newbie like me, but there and then I decided to switch to local environment as soon as I can - if only I make it through the project at hands.

I think what helped is the memory that I was in similar situations before. I mean, not more than few months earlier I had no idea what a "variable" was, and I sure remembered how overwhelmed I was in the following months when new material seemed to make no sense. And somehow I made it that far! I kind of assured myself I'd be okay, and decided to take it easy and move slowly. As a self-paced online student I had all the time in the universe and absolutely no pressure besides the one I imposed on myself.
