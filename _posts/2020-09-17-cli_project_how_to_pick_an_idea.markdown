Besides solely technical aspects of the gem creation we got to first come up with the idea for one.

I remember Avi saying in one of his lectures that design and implementation require two very different mindsets, and I cannot agree more. I tried to pursue both for a few days, but got stuck in an infinite thought loop: "What if I build this? Awesome, but I'm not sure I can make it, so let me pick something else." The mere fact that I didn't know the solution right away discouraged me from trying all along! So, I decided to through it all in the air and imagine that I can build pretty much anything.

That did it. I felt free to pick any idea, and I would think about implementation later, right? But I still couldn't make my mind: there's simply so many ideas out there! Eventually, I just asked myself, what is it I am struggling with every day, which can be fixed with a simple application?

Well, I'm not sure about you guys, but I can never pick a movie. You come home after a long day and just want to chill and watch a movie, but picking one is a hustle, right? It takes me longer to make a choice than to actually watch something! You can't imagine how many times I simply gave up and went on browsing random stuff on Youtube instead.

Anyways, I thought it would be cool to try writing a program #pick_a_movie which would pick for me. I guessed, I'd first need to show this program where to look for good stuff (like, Rotten Tomatos and such), then scrape the list of acclaimed movies and return a random pick. Boom!

By the way, I knew there were probably cool Ruby gems which did exactly that, way better designed and implemented too. But it didn't matter! Picking a movie was my legit, authentic problem, and why not to have fun writing my own authentic solution? My problem - my solution, as simple as that.
